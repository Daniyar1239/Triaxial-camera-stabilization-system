# Triaxial-camera-stabilization-system using MPU6050
Roll-pitch-yaw stabilization system using MPU6050 sensor with Arduino for filming from UAVs 


This project was done while being a tranee in the KazAeroSpace company. The project aim was to build a triaxial camera stabilization system for a special airplane used to produce a 3D map of a city.

The 3D printed stabilizer is movable in x,y,z axes. The stabilizer has spots for mounting servomotors to stabilize the cameras for all three angles (axes). 

The MPU6050 module, which contains accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, is used to register calculate all the angles. Arduino processeses the input from MPU6050 and sends commands to servomotors. 

You can build a DIY stabilizer from wood before printing the 3D prototype - as we did in the "Experimental setup" video. 

Good luck!
